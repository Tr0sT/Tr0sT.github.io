Hello World Itâ€™s Sharad!, I love making projects, having fun and enjoy playing video games.

My most impressive skills include clicking, right clicking and double clicking, as a side note, I am also well versed in **ReactJS**, **NodeJS**, **ExpressJS** and **Drinking Cold Coffee**, but mostly the **clicking thing**.

I was selected as one of the student receiving the **Intel AI Edge Scholarship** in the year **2019** and **Google India Challenge Scholarship**  in the year **2018**.

I'm currently developing a visual interface for the Ciphers in Cryptography. Here's the link: [click here](https://sharadcodes.github.io/crypto/). 


Contact me anytime for any Open Source Projects, Opportunities, Tech Talk :D or in case you need help :D .
