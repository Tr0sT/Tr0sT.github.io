Hello World Itâ€™s Sharad!, I love making projects, having fun and enjoy playing video games.

My most impressive skills include clicking, right clicking and double clicking, in my free time you will find me either doing some **Wizardry** with the code or **Drinking Cold Coffee**. If you'rnt interested then also you should check out my [Projects](https://www.codingindian.codes/projects) or my [Github Profile](https://github.com/sharadcodes) :D

I was selected as one of the student receiving the **Intel AI Edge Scholarship** in the year **2019** and **Google India Challenge Scholarship**  in the year **2018**.

I'm currently developing a visual interface for the Ciphers in Cryptography. Here's the link: [click here](https://sharadcodes.github.io/crypto/). 


Contact me anytime for the Opportunities, Open Source project ideas or in case you need help :D
