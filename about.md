Hello World It’s Sharad!, I love making projects, having fun and enjoy playing video games.

My most impressive skills include clicking, right clicking and double clicking, as a side note, I am also well versed in **ReactJS**, **NodeJS**, **ExpressJS** and **Drinking Cold Coffee**, but mostly the **clicking thing**.

I was selected as one of the student receiving the **Intel AI Edge Scholarship** in the year **2019** and **Google India Challenge Scholarship**  in the year **2019**.

I’m currently doing freelancing and side projects in API development using NodeJS & Python.
