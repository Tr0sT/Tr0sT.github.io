I've been using the cloudflare's dns 1.1.1.1 for a while and you should use it too.

If you are on android 10 you can open settings > Network & Internet > private dns.
Then click on
**Private DNS provider**
In the input box write:
```
1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com
```

That's it, your smartphone traffic is all secured now. ðŸ˜Ž
