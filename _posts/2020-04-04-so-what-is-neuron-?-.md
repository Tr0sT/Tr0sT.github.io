Hey, welcome to the series of deep learning.

This is the first post in the series if I'll get time because It's better to give quality content instead of quantity content.

So let's begin :)

## The definition of Neuron

For sake of simplicity you can define it as

> It's the smallest structural building block of a neural network.

Each and every neuron in a neural network has:
* A set of inputs from x1,x2,x2 and so on till xn
* Each input has corresponding weights i.e. x1 has w1, x2 has w2 ... xn has wn.
* A non-linear function to predict.
* A single output.
