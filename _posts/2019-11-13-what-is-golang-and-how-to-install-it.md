What is Golang, the ins ans outs as well as its installation on both Linux and Windows will be covered in this article.

Let's get started

Well Go as the word suggests it is developed by Google. Go was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

They describe it as

> “Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming.”

Or in a nutshell it is an procedural, open-source, super clean, blazing fast, flexible and an easy to maintain programming language.

Without further wait lets quickly jump on to the installation section.

I will be covering Windows, Linux and Mac installation so that everyone is covered.

## Go Installation for Windows

### Step 1: Downloading the Go lang MSI installer

```bash
System requirements are:
1. Windows 7, Server 2008R2 or later
2. Architecture: amd64, 386
```

The Go project provides two installation options for Windows users (besides installing from source): a zip archive that requires you to set some environment variables and an MSI installer that configures your installation automatically

We will go with the MSI installer as it is easy for a beginner.

First of all open this link: <https://golang.org/dl/>

This will open a page like the one shown below in the screenshot.
